# Getting help with xpectr

(Adapted from the tidyverse support guide.)

Thanks for using xpectr. Before filing an issue, please read the following:

Start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the 
[reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. If you haven't heard of or used 
reprex before, you're in for a treat! Seriously, reprex will make all of your 
R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to 
ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about). For additional reprex
pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of
the tidyverse site.

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/ludvigolsen/xpectr/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. By 
default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. You can 
[edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/) 
(e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. For example, you'd simply
remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.

Thanks for your help!
